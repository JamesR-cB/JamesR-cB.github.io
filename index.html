                                <p>Most of my projects will attempt to share common code and frameworks. As such, there are some things that are universal to all of them.</p>
								<p>This section will go over the universal, shared systems. Things unique to each project will be covered in that project's section.</p>



                                <h4>Style Guide</h4>

                                <p> 
								
								There's a few standards to how I write my code. Most of it is for visual flair, though there are some code designs that will affect what you write. 
								
								Every file starts with a header of comments, describing the file, what project it's for, and giving some documentation for how things look and feel.
								
								Comments are marked with the username of who leaves them, and some projects will also label what version of the project they are from.
								For example, Crowbar Engine has comments labeled for Crowbar 2018, Crowbar 2020, and Synchronic.
								
								</p>
								
								<p> 
								
								Namespaces are not used anywhere in the code. Namespaces can make the code simpler to read, but I don't like the way it looks and I don't like the ambiguity it can give.
								
								I realize this is not a standard thing to do, but I do the "extra work" for my own sake - it's helpful to glance at and see the full line. Yes, I'm strange.
								
								</p>
								
								
								
								
								
								
                                <hr>
                                
                                <h4> General Code Structure/Flow </h4>
                                
                                <p>
								I prefer to have all code in a dedicated file just for whatever code that one file does.
								Obviously, this won't be possible to follow 100% but if there's a situation where, for example we're adding code to deal with data compression or decompression,
								that all goes into one .h/.cpp and we would then call the function from our core logic or interface code, etc.
								</p>
								<p>
								In a similar vein of thinking, I still like the idea of having the codebase being a overall modular framework like Crowbar's original design goal - I'm not sure if this is actually practical or not though. 
								As such, if we did go for the more modular approach, I'm definitely okay with us breaking a lot of the boilerplate/framework stuff into DLL's that we can update independently of the program.
								There's some arguments to be made about linking statically vs dynamically, for cross platform's sake it makes sense to me to build it with dynamic linking in mind, not just because of the modular aspect,
								but also to help with porting that code to other systems and having to create the .so for linux, etc.
								</p>
								
								<p>
								Also, as a general rule of thumb - the codebase should be the same for all supported platforms. Obviously, if we start getting into things like porting to iOS/Android, those will need to be sepearete.
								Perhaps we can keep the theme going and have iOS/Android share a codebase - there's libraries out there that will abstract the platform stuff and let you write everything as platform agnostic and just let the framework do all the boring stuff.								
								This would probably need to be bespoke code if we port things to game consoles as well - It'd be awesome to add support to the main codebase whenever possible but on systems like the PS3 where the way the machine works will require a completely PS3-specific approach,
								we could probably get away with merely forking the project and keeping all the unique stuff in it's own fork.
								To accomplish this goal of universal projects, I like to keep specific platform code under #define blocks. ie, if #define Win32 so we can take advantage of native systems to the Win32 api. This way, if we're ready to build binaries, we just change what #define tag is active, then compile and go.
								</p>

                                <h4> Third Party libraries </h4>
								
								<p>
								There's some libraries I like to use across all my projects. It makes it super easy to get new projects up off the ground. Unless otherwise noted in the project specific documentation, these libraries will be in everything I create.
								
								
								
								</p>
								
								<h4> BuildNumber </h4>
								
								<ul>
                                <li><strong>Library name: </strong>BuildNumber</li>

                                <li><strong>Intended Use: </strong>Automatically increments build nmumber when a compile happens, even failed ones. </li>

								<li><strong>Documentation: </strong> <a href="http://buildnumber.sourceforge.net/README.TXT"target="_blank">ReadMe.txt for BuildNumber</a></li>
                                </ul>
								
								<p>
								
								This one's pretty straightforward - you set up the executable in the VS project properties, buildnumber.exe fires upon compile and edits the buildnumber.h in your project, and adds one to the buildnumber in the file. A little weird to set up, the documentation wasn't that fantastic, but it's very much set-and-forget.
								Try not to manually edit the build number - there are some times that I will go in there and edit it if there's weird edge cases like the file being locked for editing, but I want to keep it so every build incremements the build number with no exceptions.

								<h4> SFML </h4>
								
								<ul>
                                <li><strong>Library name: </strong>SFML</li>
                                <li><strong>Used version: </strong> SFML-2.4.2 Windows 32-bit (I think?) </li>
								<li><strong>License: </strong> zlib/png License </li>
                                <li><strong>Intended Use: </strong>An alternative to SDL for building platform agnostic renderers, networking, audio, input, etc. </li>
								<li><strong>URL: </strong> <a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/"target="_blank">SFML Homepage</a></li>
								<li><strong>Documentation: </strong> <a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/learn.php"target="_blank">Tutorials, API documentation and FAQ.</a></li>
                                </ul>
								
								<p>
								
								I prefer SFML to SDL for a few reasons, but most of it is because I suck and SFML is really easy to learn and use. The documentation is pretty good, and the provided examples help you learn exactly what you are doing instead of just telling you to do things.

								<h4> SimpleIni </h4>
								
								<ul>
                                <li><strong>Library name: </strong>SimpleIni</li>
                                <li><strong>Used version: </strong> 4.17 </li>
								<li><strong>License: </strong> MIT License </li>
                                <li><strong>Intended Use: </strong>Easily create and parse configuration files for your program. </li>
								<li><strong>URL: </strong> <a href="https://github.com/brofield/simpleini"target="_blank">SimpleIni on Github</a></li>
								<li><strong>Documentation: </strong> <a href="https://github.com/brofield/simpleini/blob/master/README.md"target="_blank">ReadMe.md for SimpleIni</a></li>
                                </ul>
								
								<p>
								
								SimpleIni is great. It's easy to manage, it lets you seperate different variables into different sections, so you can have for example all your audio settings under an [Audio] header.
								There's also no worry about line endings or formats, it's fairly robust and cross platform.
								
								</p>
								
								<h4> spdlog </h4>
								
								<ul>
                                <li><strong>Library name: </strong>spdlog</li>
                                <li><strong>Used version: </strong> spdlog-1.4.2 </li>
								<li><strong>License: </strong> MIT License </li>
                                <li><strong>Intended Use: </strong>Very lightweight and very performant logging system.</li>
								<li><strong>URL: </strong> <a href="https://github.com/gabime/spdlog"target="_blank">spdlog on Github</a></li>
								<li><strong>Documentation: </strong> <a href="https://github.com/gabime/spdlog/wiki"target="_blank">Github Wiki for spdlog</a></li>
                                </ul>
								
								<p>
								
								Spdlog is fantastic - header only, and is incredibly flexible so you can create your own custom logging setups, but I don't use anything other than Info, Warning and Error logging.
								Can output to console or a file. Console will be color coded, which is nice when eyeballing for gigantic red glaring errors. Most of the logging I want to contain in a #define, so we can mark a build to enable all logs, user-useful logs, only errors, disable all logs, etc.

                                <p>
								Project Contingency is a savegame backup/management system. It will have a database of known save locations, and will automatically back up the saves. It'll also be 100% user customizable. The general idea is for it to be a set and forget.
								You'll do a first time setup when installing the program, then it will automatically do it's thing depending on how you set it up.

                                <h4 id="line7_2">Project Goals </h4>
                                <p>
								There's a few design goals I have in mind for the project, and they are broken into two different categories, basically - "Need to have" and "Nice to have".
								Under "Need to have", we have the following:
								</p>
								<h3> Lightweight </h3>
								<p>
								I'm really tired of moderm programs which are just webapps that ship with a Chromium distribution, they take up obscene amounts of space for what the program does, it can be very memory intensive, and burns a lot of CPU cycles for something that should be farily lightweight, and is quite frankly a waste.
								If we build everything with native code and libraries, we can drastically reduce disk footprint and memory footprint, making it so weaker or lower end machines can still get 100% use out of the software.
								I haven't decided on actual target numbers for memory and disk usage - that will come later on in the project once we get a rough prototype working and can gauge what the project will need.
								</p>
								<h3> Cross-Platform </h3>
								<p>
								We need to have every feature we ship with work on every platform that codebase supports. ie, our desktop codebase needs to have every single feature working exactly the same in Linux, MacOS, and Windows.
								The code should also be fairly portable - if we do expand to other platforms, not having to start from scratch would be awesome.
								We also need to make it so the programs are all interconnection capable, meaning that if someone hosts a backup server on their Mac, that Mac will need to deliver the file to any client that asks. Endian-ness should not come into play here,
								as we aren't modifying the saves in any way, merely storing the date elsewhere.
								</p>
								<h3> Easy to use </h3>
								<p>
								Supporting power users is of course something we are going to allow, for people who want to roll up their sleeves and get dirty, but the UI should be simple and straightforward. The program needs to be workable by my mom with no instructions.
								Menus themselves should be kept to a minimum. Only show menus when they are relevant to the user, ie only show the cloud backup setup if they checked cloud storage as an option.
								Currently, my thought is I want it so in four screens or less, you will be set up and have everything how you want it. This might change as development progresses, but the goal needs to be to keep it as simple and straightforward as possible.
								</p>
								<p> Under "Nice to have", we have the following: </p>
								<h3> Native libraries and UI's where possible </h3>
								<p>
								If we don't go with a 100% custom UI with something like QT, I'd really like the interface to use the platform's specific style and elements. ie, on a Mac, it would use the kind of MacOS program installer interface.
								</p>

                                <p>
								The only addition to the overall Style Guide, would be to keep the UI identical across all platforms. Every button should be the same size, shape and color and be in the same spot, and do the same things when clicked.
